## *pre-1.44 _ official changelog* 
- `20231020 - 1.44`: Updated [the CFW FAQ](#is-there-any-custom-firmware) with some more details on the multicore experiment. Fixed a typo (Cave Story, not Cave Store - thanks `neddunn`!).

- `20231019 - 1.43`: Refactored [the CFW FAQ](#is-there-any-custom-firmware) to make the hcRTOS and multicore efforts more distinct. Refactored [the shortcuts FAQ](#how-do-i-change-the-four-shortcutsgames-listed-on-each-systems-main-menu-page) to mention Tadpole first (easier for most folks). Refactored [the slow SNES FAQ](#snes-games-run-really-slowly-whats-wrong) in light of 1.71. Refactored [the quiet A/V output FAQ](#when-i-connect-the-sf2000-to-a-tv-via-the-av-cable-the-sound-is-very-quietlow---is-that-normal) to suggest firmware updating first. Added details about the new 1.71 firmware version to the [Firmware](#firmwarebios-bisrvasd) and [Resources](#resources) sections, and did a lot of little edits throughout the doc as well to standardise on Data Frog's version numbering (seems to be what most folks refer to). Added a note that [the permanent bootload bugfix](#if-your-sf2000-is-currently-able-to-boot-normally) only needs to be applied once per device. Added another modification example to the analysis of [`Foldername.ini`](#foldernameini) courtesy of `wyverino`.

- `20231014 - 1.42`: Have now confirmed that no resource files changed with the new October 7th/1.7 firmware, so have updated the tables in the [Resources](#resources) section to reflect this. Also added a reference to `detyn`'s Battery Meter Fix tool to [the FAQ on stuff new SF2000 owners can do](#i-just-got-my-sf2000-what-modding-can-i-do-with-it).

- `20231012 - 1.41`: Added basic information about the new (and critically broken) October 7th/1.7 firmware version to the [Firmware](#firmwarebios-bisrvasd) section (I'm waiting for my official copy to finish downloading before updating the tables in the [Resources](#resources) sections).

- `20231010 - 1.40`: Updated [CFW FAQ](#is-there-any-custom-firmware) with the latest details, and did a little re-arranging of existing info. Changed several links to Data Frog's YouTube firmware update process to links to the [Firmware](#firmwarebios-bisrvasd) section instead, as that section has more information about other options for firmware updates (e.g., Tadpole). Added links to `dteyn`'s SNES fix tool, and information about `bnister`'s discovery as to why SNES games had to be launched twice for full speed.

- `20231003 - 1.39`: Updated [CFW FAQ](#is-there-any-custom-firmware) with the latest details. Corrected a detail about the relationship between arcade `.zfb` files and the `.zip` files they point to (thanks `.ericgoldstein`!). Added a note to the [Firmware](#firmwarebios-bisrvasd) section about the official firmware update process wiping the microSD card, and a note to the [Save States](#save-states) section about how to back up game saves (thanks for the suggestion `@uli42`!). Added [a simple firmware version checking tool](https://vonmillhausen.github.io/sf2000/tools/firmwareVersionChecker.htm), so that folks don't have to use the boot logo changer to check (which always seemed clunky to me). Added a link to `dteyn`'s Silent Sounds pack. Fixed some small typos.

- `20230926 - 1.38`: Updated [CFW FAQ](#is-there-any-custom-firmware) with the latest details. Added some additional references to Tadpole, and added credits for `jasongrieves_02643` who has been doing a lot of recent development work on the tool lately. Updated the [CPU section](#cpu) to reference the fact that the CPU clock has been increased in the latest firmware. Added links to `iq_132`'s Bluetooth mod. Added [a section about the `.zfb` files](#zfb-files) used in the arcade section. Rearranged the details in [the Bootloader Bug section](#bootloader-bug) to hopefully make things a bit clearer.

- `20230905 - 1.37`: Added note about `bnister`'s CPU clock bump discovery to the [Firmware](#firmwarebios-bisrvasd) section. Added link to `dteyn`'s new background music tool to the [Sounds](#sounds) and [Tools and Links](#tools-and-links) sections.

- `20230829 - 1.35`: Added a [MicroSD Card](#microsd-card) section to [Hardware](#hardware) to provide some detail about the SF2000's slightly unusual microSD card situation. Added detail about the [Neo Geo Unibios Menu](#neo-geo-unibios-menu) discovery to the [Arcade](#arcade) section (thanks `nanchon18#2262`!). Updated the custom firmware FAQ with the latest details. Updated the "what modding can I do" FAQ to strongly suggest fixing the [bootloader bug](#bootloader-bug) before doing any other modding to the device; also added a note that the Tadpole tool can perform a lot of the modding tasks. Updated the "quiet A/V sound" FAQ with details about the fix in the 1.6 firmware. Updated the "in game saves don't work" FAQ with details about this apparently being fixed for GBA in the 1.6 firmware. Added a note to the [Battery](#battery) section about the SF2000's poorly calibrated power monitoring curve, along with a link to `dteyn`'s SF2000 Battery Level Patcher script (also added a link to that in the [Tools and Links](#tools-and-links) section). Data Frog has now officially released the 1.6 firmware, so added that to the [Firmware](#firmwarebios-bisrvasd) section; also updated all of the tables in the [Resources](#resources) section to include the new firmware. Finally, renamed this "Version History" section to "Document Version History", to help prevent any confusion in regards to what the version numbers in this section refer to (they're not related to firmware).
