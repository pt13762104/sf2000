The device has an IPS panel (not OCA laminated), and a user-replaceable 18650 battery, which can be charged via a USB-C port on the device. It also has analog A/V out (note: not HDMI), meaning it can be connected to a CRT TV - the type of display most arcade, Genesis/Mega Drive and SNES games were originally intended to be displayed on. It has a built-in 2.4GHz antenna, and can receive input from a compatible wireless controller (usually sold separately).</p> <p>Some downsides to the device: There's a decent amount of screen-tearing, due to a difference between the display panel's refresh rate and the rate at which it's fed image data by the rest of the hardware (although this has been shown to be mostly addressable via software changes). It's mono only; and worse yet, you only get the left-channel audio (so stereo games just lack the right audio channel entirely). There's no headphone jack (although there is a volume wheel), screen brightness cannot be altered (it's fairly bright), SNES and Game Boy Advance are hit-or-miss in terms of performance (some games are fine, many games run unplayably slowly), the stock firmware is closed-source so the device's performance may never get any better than as-shipped, and some folks have had issues with the buttons (quality control is hit-or-miss, and some folks have had terrible button response, such as a d-pad that can't do diagonals reliably, or ABXY buttons that sit flush with or even go under the case). Finally, while the device features A/V out, it does so in a slightly odd resolution (576i) which may result in borders being chopped off on your TV, depending on how your TV deals with the signal.</p> <p>So is the \"Data Frog\" any good? Only you can answer that question for yourself. There are certainly more powerful devices out there, more fully featured devices, devices with better hardware, etc. - but almost all of those devices cost a lot more than the SF2000 (which often sells for just $15 to $20). At the end of the day, you have to look at the features offered at the given price-point, and only then can you decide if you're interested in the device or not.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#is-there-any-custom-firmware","title":"Is there any custom firmware?","text":"<p>As of December 10th 2023, no, not yet; however, some already-useful advancements have been made which may be of interest. Two main development efforts have been made:</p>"},{"location":"faq/#hcrtos-true-cfw","title":"hcRTOS (true CFW)","text":"<p>Earlier this year, an SDK for the CPU in the SF2000 was been identified. Theoretically, this would allow a full custom firmware to be built and compiled for the device. The developers working on custom firmware spent some considerable time and effort working on porting Retroarch (as it seemed like it would be the quickest route to a custom firmware with support for many systems), however they ran into several problems. It appears that the SDK was unfinished and of low quality - core features like video and audio drivers were missing (and thus had to be developed from scratch), and overall system stability of the produced builds very low. When crashed happened with running cores (which was frequently) no useful debugging information was produced, and so tracking down the source of issues became a major time-sink. Additionally, most of the experimental builds when they did work had audio and/or video performance issues, and most also caused the SF2000 to run \"hot\", which would likely have impacted the lifespan of the device and thus are not recommended for usage beyond a few minutes at a time. A GitLab repo was set up by <code>ignatzdraconis</code> for the work based on this SDK, however work on developing a full custom firmware using this SDK has been parked for now.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#multicore-modified-stock","title":"Multicore (modified stock)","text":"<p>More recently, a new tack is being tried by the development team - they're trying to modify the stock SF2000 firmware to add additional functionality. Theoretically, this would come with the benefit of having audio and video drivers already built (the contractors producing the stock firmware for the SF2000 have access to these), providing no worse performance than stock firmware, while also providing features like support for additional emulated systems. An experimental developer build called the \"multicore\" build has been produced which hijacks the stock Game Boy Advance emulator to run additional systems like Atari 2600, PC-Engine, MAME2000, Sega 32X, etc., and some stand-alone engines for games like Doom and Cave Story, as well as alternatives for some of the stock emulators already included with the SF2000 (e.g., a more recent build of gpSP, Snes9x 2005 and 2002, etc.). Some of the new systems appear to run at full speed; some run without sound or with less than full speed, and others don't work at all yet. A GitLab repo has been set up by <code>kobil</code> for the work on modifying the stock firmware; additionally, a GitHub repo has been set up by <code>adcockm</code> for the code changes for the individual cores, and you can download the experimental alpha build from the \"Releases\" page there. If you want to follow along with the developer chat on this work, see the <code>SF2000 Dev</code> thread in the <code>\ud83d\udc38data_frog_sf2000</code> channel of the <code>Retro Handhelds</code> Discord server.

Seriously - do this before you do anything else!</p> <p>Afterwards, in no particular order, some of the current customisation options available are:</p> <ul> <li>I'm not kidding - fix the bootloader bug before you do anything with your SF2000!</li> <li>You can potentially upgrade the firmware to the latest version (many of the other things below modify your installed firmware, so if you're going to do some of the others, do this one before them)</li> <li>You can swap out the buttons and d-pad (and their membranes) for ones from original SNES controllers (not SNES Classic), which gives a more retro \"mushy\" feel (if your replacement buttons have 3 \"pins\", you may need to file or clip one of the pins off)</li> <li>You can swap the battery for a higher-capacity <code>3500 mAh</code> 18650, which will give you longer playtime (at the cost of longer charging time). If you do decide to replace the battery, make sure you use one with a built-in protection circuit, as the SF2000 has no under-charge protection.</li> <li>You can patch the battery monitoring curve for the stock battery to make it more accurate using a web tool by <code>dteyn</code> (only use if you're keeping the stock battery; if you've put in a more powerful battery, the stock battery monitoring curve should be fine)</li> <li>You can replace the boot logo with a custom one</li> <li>You can replace the main menu music, or remove it entirely</li> <li>You can change the default button mappings for each emulator (newer firmwares have this feature built-in, but the built-in implementation is buggy)</li> <li>You can add your own ROMs to the <code>roms</code> folder on the microSD card, which will then appear in the user ROMs menu of the device. You can also modify the built-in ROM lists using FROGTOOL</li> <li>You can replace the default menu theme with a custom one</li> <li>You can fix a bug with SNES emulation if you're using a firmware version prior to 1.71</li> </ul> <p>Many of the above tasks can be done using Tadpole, a general management tool for the SF2000 developed by <code>.ericgoldstein</code> and <code>jasongrieves_02643</code>.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-install-new-menu-themes","title":"How do I install new menu themes?","text":"<p>The SF2000 doesn't natively support themes at all; however, all of the images and sounds for the stock theme live in the <code>Resources</code> folder on the microSD card. Therefore, by simply replacing the stock theme's files, the stock theme can be replaced.</p> <p>A centralised repository for boot logos, custom themes and background music has been created by <code>Zerter#4954</code>, which you can find here; you can also find many of them linked in the <code>The Frog's Best Bits \ud83d\udc38</code> thread of the <code>\ud83d\udc38data_frog_sf2000</code> channel in the <code>Retro Handhelds</code> Discord server.</p> <p>The community built tool Tadpole can be used to change the theme on the SF2000, amongst many other features.</p> <p>If you wish to manually install a theme you've downloaded, just take the files from the theme, and use them to replace the existing files on the microSD card. You might want to make your own backup of the stock <code>Resources</code> folder first, in case you want to go back to the stock theme yourself at a later date. Note also that in addition to theme assets, the <code>Resources</code> folder also contains data files related to your button mapping, favourites and history, etc.; so when backing up or replacing files in <code>Resources</code> for themes, just be aware not to overwrite anything non-theme-related you want to keep.</p> <p>Another thing to note: some themes might come with an updated boot logo. If that logo is provided as a <code>bisrv.asd</code> file in the <code>bios</code> folder, this is actually a modified firmware for the device, which happens to contain the new logo. If you decide to replace your existing <code>bisrv.asd</code> file, you might want to make sure that the theme's firmware version matches the firmware version already on your device. Generally, it's probably safer just to update your own firmware's boot logo with an image file.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-change-the-four-shortcutsgames-listed-on-each-systems-main-menu-page","title":"How do I change the four shortcuts/games listed on each system's main menu page?","text":"<p>Recent versions of Tadpole by <code>.ericgoldstein</code> and <code>jasongrieves_02643</code> have support for changing the shortcuts if you're looking for an automated way to do things.

This bug was fixed in firmware 1.71, so you can upgrade to that firmware version to fix things. If you don't want to upgrade to 1.71, there are two other ways to fix or work-around the issue:</p> <ul> <li><code>Dteyn</code> has created a web-based tool which will patch your BIOS with a workaround to correct the issue - you can find their tool here;</li> <li>Quitting back to the game selection menu via <code>START + SELECT</code>, and then immediately re-launching the game again will get the game to run at full speed the second time around; this would need to be done at least once every time you power on the SF2000.</li> </ul> <p>Note however that the stock firmware does also struggle a bit with SNES emulation in general, so any slowdown or poor SNES performance you see after addressing the bug is just what you get.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#help-my-sf2000-wont-turn-on-or-is-stuck-at-a-black-screen","title":"Help!

Fixed the SNES/Genesis swapped button mappings, and now sets Player 2 controls to be identical to Player 1 (no way to set independently).

The reasons for this have not yet been determined. If you've swapped over to using a non-stock microSD card, and your SF2000 isn't booting (and you've ruled out the bootloader bug), then there's a good chance your SF2000 just won't work with the microSD card you're using.</p>"},{"location":"sf2000/hardware/#battery","title":"Battery","text":"<p>The SF2000 takes a 18650 type rechargeable battery, which is easily user replaceable (it's behind a battery door with a screw), and comes with a 1,500mAh one which runs for about 4 hours. 18650 batteries with and without \"nubs\" both fit fine. The console has built-in over-charge protection, but does not have under-charge protection, so for safety do not leave the console turned on when the battery is low. From when it displays a full-screen low battery indicator, it takes about 3.5 hours to charge the stock battery. The green charging light does not turn off when fully charged.</p> <p>Also note that while you can technically charge the SF2000 while it is powered on, doing so using a charger that supports fast charging or power delivery has a high chance of blowing the charging module IC and killing the device (multiple community reports). For safest charging, use a charger that only supports a maximum output of 5v.</p> <p>The stock firmware's power monitoring system (which controls the battery level indicator on the main menu, along with when the device warns the user about a low battery condition) is poorly calibrated for the stock battery that comes with the device; as such, the SF2000 basically indicates it has a full battery at all times. <code>bnister</code> and <code>dteyn</code> from Discord worked together to identify the locations within the stock firmware where the calibrations are stored, and determined more appropriate calibration values for the stock battery. <code>dteyn</code> wrote a web-based tool which will patch an existing <code>bisrv.asd</code> file to use the new values; you can find their \"Data Frog SF2000 Battery Meter Fix\" tool here.

When outputting a PAL signal, while the signal is indeed 50Hz, it seems like the emulators are still targeting 60Hz output - PAL scrolling is \"jerky\". Switching the device to output NTSC, scrolling becomes smooth. This holds true regardless of using a PAL or NTSC version of a ROM. Depending on your external display, video output over A/V may be somewhat heavily cropped on all screen edges - if so, this can result in UI elements at screen edges in games (health bars, remaining credits, etc.) being out-of-frame. Switching between PAL and NTSC doesn't alter the visible screen area.

It has been reported that (if you have sufficient soldering skills) those two resistors can be added to enable USB-C to USB-C charging.

It's a plain-text file, but not an actual INI file.

Internally they are numbered from 0; so the <code>ROMS</code> section (user ROMs and settings) is 0, <code>FC</code> (NES) is 1, <code>SFC</code> (SNES) is 2, etc.. The <code>FF8000</code> is the hexadecimal colour (RGB) to display the text of the currently selected/highlighted game in the list; the default colour is orange. Side note: after the <code>ARCADE</code> section, there's two additional <code>ROMS</code> sections; the firmware is hard-coded to have ten sections. The SF2000 appears to share its firmware with other similar devices, and some of those devices feature different menu sections (e.g., \"CPS1\", \"Neo Geo\", etc.). I suspect that the best of those systems has ten sections in its main menu, which doesn't match up with the eight sections on the SF2000 (seven supported systems + the user ROMs/settings section). As the firmware requires ten sections to be defined, they just repeated the <code>ROMS</code> section to fill in the remaining places. Like I say, that's just a guess!</li> <li><code>8 7 0</code>: This is used to control the main menu rotation. <code>8</code> tells the firmware how many main menu sections are actually in-use on this device; for the SF2000 that's seven supported consoles + the user ROMs/settings section, for eight total. <code>7</code> tells the firmware which menu section to default to when the device boots up, which is why by default it always starts in the <code>ARCADE</code> section. <code>0</code> tells the firmware which section to display the special \"user settings\" menu on (the one with History, Favourites, TV System, Language, etc.). So for example, if you wanted the SF2000 to start up on the user ROMs/settings screen instead of Arcade, you could change this line to read <code>8 0 0</code>; or if you wanted the user ROMs/settings screen to be the only screen available (e.g., if you were intending to hand the device to someone unfamiliar with retro emulation, and you wanted to reduce sources of confusion for them), you could set it to <code>1 0 0</code> (suggestion from <code>wyverino</code>)</li> <li><code>24 184 144 208</code>: These numbers control the position and size of the game artwork in each system's game-list. The first two numbers are the X and Y coordinates from the top-left corner of the screen for where to start drawing the artwork; the second two numbers are the width and height of the artwork to draw. Note that the SF2000 doesn't do any image scaling; the dimensions are for the rectangular area the device will begin adding each pixel of the source artwork to.

The fact that the SF2000's UI resources are pulled from the microSD card opens up the door to \"theming\" the device, which is great. However, if you do decide you want to make a theme for the SF2000, here's a few things I've found that you may want to bear in mind:</p> <ul> <li>If you're including background music in your theme, note that when the SF2000 starts up it fails to output about the first 1 second of audio; therefore, if you'd like the person using your theme to hear your background music from the start, cut one second off the end of your background music loop, and move it to the start of the loop instead.</li> <li>If you're creating custom system logos (<code>sfcdr.cpl</code>), make sure the logos don't overlap the \"Games Exist\" image's screen area (<code>exaxz.hsp</code>, top-left coordinate <code>456, 88</code>, width and height <code>152, 72</code>); the main menu compositor clips an area of the section's background image behind where the \"Games Exist\" artwork will be drawn, renders the \"Games Exist\" artwork into that clipped section, and then draws the result on top of the system logo. As a result, any pixels of the system logo that should be visible in that area will be replaced by the background image, even if you make the \"Games Exist\" image fully transparent. Removing the <code>exaxz.hsp</code> file entirely doesn't work either, as you get garbage drawn on the screen in the same area instead. The only section not impacted by this is the \"User ROMs and Settings\" section, as on that screen the \"Games Exist\" artwork is not drawn.</li> <li>There's a workaround, but it's not perfect: you can bake a system's logo directly into the background for its main-menu section, and make it's portion of <code>sfcdr.cpl</code> fully transparent (so that you don't see the logo physically moving). As the code for drawing the \"Games Exist\" image pulls from the section's background, it'll pull the portion that overlaps with the system logo and render that too. The downside is that the poor draw code of the stock OS only updates the horizontal portion of the screen that contains the rotating logos during section transitions, and only draws the lower portion of the screen (the bit under the rotating logos) afterwards. So baking your logo into background for the section will create some artificial \"latency\" for the theme user - they'll see the new logo appear instantly, then have to wait the quarter second for the invisible \"rotation\" animation to complete, before the lower portion of the screen with the new shortcuts for the new section appears.</li> <li>One other workaround (that's even worse than the first workaround): bake just the portion of the system logo that overlaps with <code>exaxz.hsp</code> into the background. Doing it this way, you can still have your custom system logo in <code>sfcdr.cpl</code>, and still have it in the rotation animation (which gives the user something to look at, and reduces that fake \"latency\" feeling from the workaround above)... but you'll see the bit of logo baked into the background appear instantly, and then the rotating logo will slide up/down to meet it, so it'll still look a bit janky. So really it comes down to picking your particular flavour of jank: scaling your logos to avoid the <code>exaxz.hsp</code> screen area (which might leave you with a lot of empty space), baking your logo into the section background (adding fake \"latency\" to the experience), or only partially baking your logo into the section background (which will make things look jank during the rotation animation, but perfect otherwise)... the decision is yours!</li> <li>When designing your theme, think carefully about the use case in which you want your theme to look best. Although the SF2000 uses many different UI images at many different scales, internally the screen area it draws to is <code>640 x 480</code> pixels in size. However, the actual physical display is only <code>320 x 240</code>; as the SF2000's OS does not do any image resampling when downscaling its UI output to the screen, what essentially happens is every second row and column of pixels is thrown away - and as a result, a theme designed for the internal <code>640 x 480</code> resolution can look a bit aliased or \"jagged\" on the internal display. If you want your theme to look pixel-perfect on the internal display, design it for <code>320 x 240</code> instead (i.e., for any image asset you create, design and create it at half of the original resolution of the same file in the stock SF2000 theme), and perform a nearest-neighbour upscale of the image back to the original resolution when converting it to an SF2000 data format. The resulting images will be pixel perfect on the internal display. HOWEVER... there is one major downside to do thing this: AV output. When using the AV output of the SF2000, it does so at 576i - higher than the resolution of the internal display. If you're using a theme that was scaled up from a <code>320 x 240</code> design base, you can clearly see pixelisation of the UI assets on the external display; a <code>640 x 480</code> based theme displays smooth assets. So what if you want to design a theme that looks decently sharp (not aliased) on the internal display, and looks decently smooth on an external display, then design your theme for three-quarters resolution (<code>480 x 360</code> design base), and do a bilinear upscale to <code>640 x 480</code> based resolutions during final data conversion. To summarise:</li> <li>If you only care about how your theme looks on the internal display, and don't care about how it looks on AV output, design for a <code>320 x 240</code> base resolution and do a nearest-neighbour 2x upscale when converting to SF2000 formats</li> <li>If you only care about how your theme looks via AV out, and don't care about it looking aliased/jagged on the internal display, design for the regular <code>640 x 480</code> base</li> <li>If you care about both display types, and want your theme to look great (but not perfect) on both, design for a three-quarters <code>480 x 360</code> base, and do a bilinear upscale to regular <code>640 x 480</code> base resolutions when converting to SF2000 formats</li> </ul>"}]}
